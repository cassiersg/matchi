Use control signal stability (require annotations that a control signal is glitch-free). (*msk_glitch_free="assume" *) (* msk_glitch_free="assert" *).

Check glitch-sensitivity on output, not only sensitivity.

Cycle count progress bar, framework for error messages.

annotation in separate files

assumption on non-marked DFF: stop glitches or not ?

check pipeline structure for pipeline gadgets, and latency annotations

Get back:
- isolate strategy
- no transitions
- check state cleared
- other errors from FV1?
